                <h6>Description</h6>
                <p class="card-text">The main objective of creating the site was to bring awareness to a certain environtmental issue. Using the website 350.org a topic was chosen and researched.</p>
                <h6>Planning</h6>
                <p class="card-text">Before creating the final website, several different topics concerning the environment and climate change was researched on the website 350.org. Several different sketches as to what kind of different layouts and environments could be created. These ideas were thought of more in a 2D space rather than 3D which allowed a plan to be created as to how the website would also function for the user. Several different tutorial videos were also provided as to how environments could be created in Cinema4D and additional instruction on how to use WebGL. </p>
                <h6>Process</h6>
                <p class="card-text">The process begun with researching the main topic of the website which was forest fires. Using the information on 350.org different facts about what forest fires did, how they were caused and how they affected our planet were noted down to be put on the website. The main model that would be used on the website was created using various simple geometric shapes in Cinema4D. With this the model was then imported. Using WebGL all the moving point of the model were created along with the triggers that would activate the text boxes. There was also the creation of what the site would be called and a logo that was created for it as well. Different assets and typefaces were also explored to see what would work best for the design of the site.</p>
