                <p>Team of 2</p>
                <h6>Overveiw</h6>
                <p class="card-text">MiWay is a transit company that deals with public transportation in the city of Mississauga. The MiWay mobile app allows users to keep track of their daily trips and school/work schedules. The app also allows users to keep up to date with their trip such as if it’s delayed due to traffic or if a bus is overfilled with passengers. This cuts out the need for users to use the mobile browser version of the MiWay website which also doesn’t include these features.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The main reason this prototype was created was because of the lack of a real app for the MiWay transit way. Combined with the fact that as someone that commutes regularly, the lack of a mobile app for the MiWay transit causes a lot of inconveniences to daily commuting.
                </p>
                <h6>Problem</h6>
                <p class="card-text">MiWay transit as of 2021 doesn't have a mobile app for people to use. The mobile browser is very slow and difficult to use. The browser website also didn’t translate properly to mobile visually, causing information to be cluttered and smashed together. Passengers experience buses coming too early or too late to their stops, either because ofdelays on the road or because of other external factors. The site is also sometimes inaccurate withthe bus stop destinations due to the site sometimes stating there is a bus for a certain route when there isn’t. Passengers become frustrated because they end up missing other buses, they needed to transfer onto at certain times or end up late for their appointments.


                </p>
                <h6>User Research</h6>
                <p class="card-text">To fully understand the scope of what people felt when using public transit, people were asked to participate in an interview that answered a few questions related to it. Through the research the main the pain points that users had were:
                    - Affordable transit
                    - Trip updates
                    - Traffic information
                    - Time inaccuracies
                </p>
                <h6>Final</h6>
                <img src="extra/app1.png" width="36%;" style="float:left;">
                <img src="extra/app2.png" width="36%;" style="float:left;">

                <img src="extra/app07.png" width="36%;" style="float:left;">
                <img src="extra/app08.png" width="36%;" style="float:left;">
                <img src="extra/app09.png" width="36%;" style="float:left;">
                <img src="extra/app10.png" width="36%;" style="float:left;">
                <h6>Final Thoughts</h6>
                <p class="card-text">Looking back on the project I would’ve conducted more user research to gain a wider understanding of people’s opinions. I also would’ve given myself more time to conduct the research since finding people available to interview at the time was a major obstacle. </p>
