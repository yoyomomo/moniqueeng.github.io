                <h6>Description</h6>
                <p class="card-text">The main objective of creating the website was to focus on the look, feel, and functionality of what could be a potential social media platform. The site used MySQL, PHP, and Bootstrap to create the website and user onboarding process.</p>
                <h6>Planning</h6>
                <p class="card-text">The planning process to create the site mainly focused on what kind of social media platform could be created. After analyzing how different social media platforms such as Twitter, Instagram and Reddit bring users in, a similar process for this site was brainstormed as well. Using entity relationship diagrams we mimicked user onboarding systems to understand how potential users would log in or sign up for the site, how they would create and interact with posts and how users would interact with other users. There was also the planning process of what kind of social media platform the site would be. In the end it was decided that the site would be a social media platform meant for users who watched television shows and movies. Playing on the idea that people who spend time watching shows are “couch potatoes” the website name became Spuds.</p>
                <h6>Process</h6>
                <p class="card-text">The creation process of the site used a base template provided in class that allowed the team to modify it as heavily as they wanted to while maintaining the integrity of the user onboarding functions. Using PHP and CSS the team went thru various kinds of colour schemes, backgrounds images, and icon styles.</p>
                <h6>Final</h6>
                <h6>Final Thoughts</h6>
                <p class="card-text">Looking back on the project a few changes could be made such as having a more in depth understanding of how MySQL functioned for the onboarding process. Especially when trying to add more features caused the onboarding process to crash completely.</p>
